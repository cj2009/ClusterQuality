# ClusterQuality

This is a NetBeans project that is meant to calculate some statistics about the clusters produced by he Barycentric Clustering and Markov Clustering algorithms.

BCClusterQuality:
 * This class provides some useful statistics about the clusters produced by the BC program. It requires the outputs from NodeXL, which is a list of edges in which each line contains an ID of a cluster and the 2 vertices of that edge.
 
MCLClusterQuality:
  * This class provides some useful statistics about the clusters produced by the Hadoop MCL program. It requires the outputs of both MR5 and MR6.
